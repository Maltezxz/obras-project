-- Drop all existing policies on users table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Host can view their funcionarios" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Host can insert funcionarios" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Host can update their funcionarios" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow host user creation" ON users;

-- Allow anyone to insert (temporarily for setup)
CREATE POLICY "Allow public insert for setup"
  ON users FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow viewing own data or funcionarios
CREATE POLICY "Users can view profiles"
  ON users FOR SELECT
  USING (true);

-- Allow updating own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own data"
  ON users FOR UPDATE
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Note: After initial setup, these policies should be restricted
